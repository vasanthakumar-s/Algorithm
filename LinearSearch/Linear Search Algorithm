Linear Search

Linear Search is used to find an elament from multiple elements.
Best Time Complexity - O(1) - If element is found in the 0th index
Worst Time Complexity - O(n) - If the element is not present in the array and 'n' may denote the length of the array

Consider we have to find a element in the array.
array = 3, 9, 7, 1, 6, 5, 8

Step 1: Traverse the array
Step 2: Match the key element with array element
Step 3: If key element is found, return the index position of the array element
Step 4: If key element is not found, return -1
